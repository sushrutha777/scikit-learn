Scikit-Learn Fundamentals
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook documenting my journey through essential concepts of scikit-learn. The notebook provides a hands-on approach to understanding various machine learning algorithms, preprocessing techniques, model evaluation metrics, and practical examples.

Contents
Introduction to Scikit-Learn: A brief overview of scikit-learn, its features, and the machine learning workflow.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical data, and splitting datasets.
Supervised Learning:
Classification Algorithms: Examples include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Regression Algorithms: Includes Linear Regression and its variations.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering techniques such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, AUC/ROC, and cross-validation.
